{"tagline":"Automation scripts focused around Mac OS X Server","body":"### We try to make Mac servers \"just work\"\r\n[Mac Mini Vault][] is division of [CyberLynk][] , a data center company located near Milwaukee, WI.  We have hundreds of Macs in our data center.  Right now we are up to four dedicated 48U cabinets that do nothing but host Mac minis.  Each of which can hold up to 140 Mac minis. \r\n[CyberLynk]: http://www.cyberlynk.net/\r\n[Mac Mini Vault]: http://www.macminivault.com/\r\nNormally colocation is hands-off from the view point of the data center.  The customer owns the equipment and ultimately runs their own show.  Our approach is slightly different.  We have free hands-on support hours.  We also do a lot of testing.  The testing that we do revolves around making our customer's lives easier and automating the living hell out of any manual task.  Manual tasks can be messy, include typos, an most unfortunately render a machine dead in the water.\r\n\r\nWe've done things like create 10 different operating system 'images' for the 2011 Mac mini hardware.  This includes 3 distributions of Linux, Windows Server 2k8/2k12, and even OS X 10.6 and 10.6 Server.  We've also created little apps or scripts that automate tasks that we regularly see customers struggle with.\r\n\r\nWe have taken a few scripts that we've complied and put them in this GitHub project to further develop and grow them.\r\n\r\n### VPN Script\r\nThis script sets up a VPN server on a Mac running 10.8 with Server.app.  Be sure to read the vpnscript-README first. This script automates the VLAN, DNS, Firewall, and VPN configuration steps.  Running it is as simple as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sh vpnscript.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### More to come!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nhttp://www.macminivault.com is our website.  We support our customers, but if you have questions and are not our customer we can try to lend a helping hand.  If you ever have a need to place a Mac in a secure location with a lot of bandwidth, fire suppression, security, and backup power - be sure to look us up.\r\n","google":"UA-490785-31","note":"Don't delete this file!
